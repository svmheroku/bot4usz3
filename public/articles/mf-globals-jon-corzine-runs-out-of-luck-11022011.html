								<h1>MF Global&rsquo;s Jon Corzine Runs Out of Luck</h1>
							
								<h2>The company&rsquo;s bankruptcy may well mark the end of a political and investing career distinguished by aggressive risk-taking</h2>
							
				<p class="author">By 
<a href="/bios/roben-farzad-2140.html" title="Roben Farzad" rel="author">Roben Farzad</a>				</p>
							

                            
                            <p>In his 24-year career at <ticker symbol="GS">Goldman Sachs</ticker>, Jon Corzine made a name for himself as an intrepid trader who pushed the limits of risk. So it makes sense that when Corzine, after almost a decade as a U.S. senator and governor, was named chairman and chief executive officer of MF Global Holdings in March&nbsp;2010, his plan for expanding the futures and commodities trader involved taking more risk. Less than 20 months later the company is bankrupt, days after posting a $192&nbsp;million quarterly loss and disclosing $6.3 billion in bets on European government bonds. &ldquo;This goes back to the myth of Goldman people being the best risk takers,&rdquo; says Janet Tavakoli, who once worked at Goldman Sachs and is now president of Tavakoli Structured Finance, a Chicago firm that advises institutional investors.</p>
<p>Wall Street applauded Corzine&rsquo;s appointment. MF Global shares rose 15&nbsp;percent the week his hiring was announced. Says Rob Rutschow, an analyst at investment bank CLSA: &ldquo;It was like, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s Jon Corzine: very connected, very successful ex-Goldman guy. Take him at his word that he&rsquo;s going to build a world-class, full-service investment bank.&rsquo; &rdquo; And Corzine struck a statesman-like chord on taking the job. &ldquo;MF Global is a firm with tremendous potential and excellent talent,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Profitability and responsibility must go hand in hand with growing our franchise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet the bankrupcty exposed a lack of internal controls. The day it filed for Chapter 11 protection, New York-based MF Global disclosed a shortfall in customer accounts that people with knowledge of the matter said may be about $700 million. On Nov. 1 a lawyer for MF Global told a bankruptcy judge that all customer money has been accounted for. That same day, Craig Donohue, CEO of <ticker symbol="CME">CME Group</ticker>, which has regulatory authority over MF Global, said the company violated requirements that it keep clients&rsquo; collateral separate from its own accounts. &ldquo;We are investigating the circumstances of the firm&rsquo;s failure,&rdquo; he said. Corzine did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>While Corzine is known for making aggressive bets, at Goldman Sachs he had to operate within a larger, more cautious corporate culture because partners&rsquo; own capital was on the line. At MF Global, Corzine had fewer people looking over his shoulder. &ldquo;MF Global was a case of, &lsquo;Ratchet up the risk. Let us Goldman guys fix this,&rsquo; &rdquo; says William D. Cohan, author of <em>Money and Power: How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the World</em> and a contributor to Bloomberg View.</p>
<p>At Goldman Sachs, Corzine was known for having the nerve to stick with his trades even when they seemed doomed. In 1986 he was responsible for a bet on Treasuries that was losing $150 million, according to several published reports. For five months he refused to cut his losses and ultimately made the firm $10&nbsp;million when the market changed course.</p>
<p>In 1994 traders working for Corzine were losing $100&nbsp;million a month on bad interest-rate wagers, according to Cohan&rsquo;s book, prompting several partners to depart. Corzine again resisted calls to stanch the losses, which contributed to pretax profit plunging 80&nbsp;percent that year. Even so, by Christmas he was running all of Goldman Sachs. &ldquo;I could never figure out why out of that he became senior partner,&rdquo; says Cohan. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the only guy who became head of Goldman who makes me scratch my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In January&nbsp;1995, at a management meeting, Corzine challenged fellow partners to take more risk with the firm&rsquo;s own capital and to lift Goldman Sachs&rsquo;s profits to $2&nbsp;billion a year for the next five years, according to Cohan. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t achieve the kinds of returns we want just by buying on the bid and selling on the offer,&rdquo; Corzine told <em>Institutional Investor</em> magazine in September&nbsp;1995.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs rode a lucrative wave of mergers and acquisitions and winning trades in the &rsquo;90s bull market. Then in mid-1998 came Russia&rsquo;s financial crisis. The bank suffered $1&nbsp;billion in trading losses in the ensuing global stock and bond sell-off and failure of hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management. By the end of the year, Corzine was pushed out of Goldman Sachs by Henry Paulson, who had been co-CEO for six months and later served as Treasury Secretary.</p>
<p>Risk taking is not confined to Corzine&rsquo;s financial career. At least $400&nbsp;million richer from Goldman Sachs&rsquo;s 1999 initial public offering, he spent $60&nbsp;million of his own money on a successful bid for a U.S. Senate seat in New Jersey, which he then parlayed into his 2005 election as governor. In April&nbsp;2007 he was critically injured in a car crash north of Atlantic City while being driven in an SUV going 90&nbsp;mph. He wasn&rsquo;t wearing a seat belt. In a public service announcement recorded after the accident, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine, and I should be dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After losing his 2009 gubernatorial reelection bid to Chris Christie, Corzine returned to Wall Street. J. Christopher Flowers, a friend and former Goldman Sachs banker who had a stake in MF Global, recruited Corzine to transform the small futures and commodities dealer into a full-service broker. That would mean taking greater risks by having the company make more and bigger bets with its own capital. As recently as May a company announcement touted &ldquo;significant sales and trading hires&rdquo; from rival banks, including new heads of mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities sales and a head of equity derivatives sales.</p>
<p>Risk taking began to account for a greater share of the company&rsquo;s revenue. In reporting results for the quarter ended in June&nbsp;2011, MF Global said that revenue from trading with the firm&rsquo;s own money and from taking the other side of client trades rose to 42&nbsp;percent of sales, from 23&nbsp;percent a year earlier. Rutschow, the CLSA analyst, not convinced the brokerage was moving in the right direction, put a sell rating on the shares when they traded at $8 a year ago. &ldquo;You were looking at a company with so little capital taking on billions in risks,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Sean Egan, managing director of credit rating firm Egan-Jones Ratings, says MF Global had put itself in a perilous position: It was using so much borrowed money to make investments that a mere 2.5&nbsp;percent fall in the value of its assets could bankrupt the company. The day before announcing its record quarterly loss, MF disclosed it owned $6.3&nbsp;billion of bonds issued by Ireland, Italy, Spain, Belgium, and Portugal.</p>
<p>After MF Global&rsquo;s announcement other banks, hedge funds, and even its own clients stopped dealing with the company. MF Global&rsquo;s board met through the weekend of Oct.&nbsp;30 to consider options including a sale, a person with direct knowledge of the situation says. The firm was in discussions with five potential buyers for all or parts of the company, including banks, private-equity firms, and brokers. Discrepancies over the client funds sent Interactive Brokers Group fleeing from a potential acquisition. &ldquo;The board certainly considered that purchase and stepped away from it at a point where it became clear there were lots of uncertainties about the accounts and segregated funds,&rdquo; says Hans R. Stoll, an Interactive Brokers director and professor of finance at Vanderbilt University.</p>
<p>With Corzine unable to find a buyer, MF Global filed for protection from creditors on Oct.&nbsp;31. With $41&nbsp;billion in assets, it was the eighth-largest U.S. bankruptcy ever and may well mark the end of Corzine&rsquo;s investing career. &ldquo;Ironically it was his misjudgments of major trades which have been highly costly to both Goldman and now MF,&rdquo; says Egan. &ldquo;We have seen this before: Traders fall in love with their trades and have little ability to take a measured, dispassionate view.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="note"><em><strong>The bottom line:</strong> MF Global was driven to bankruptcy after disclosing a $192 million quarterly loss and big bets on European bonds.</em></p>
